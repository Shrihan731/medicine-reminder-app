Medicine Reminder
Medicines are life saving sometimes and if we forget to take them because of our daily chores then it's not advised because it can reduce the affect or the reason for which you are taking the medicines would get bad or somtimes worst.
To solve this problem I cam up with this reminder page which is very user friendly , in which you have to enter name of medicine , time and quantity and it will automatically remind you for that.
But make sure to keept the web page open and allow the notifications for this page.I used css,html & js to build this.
Most people forget reminders… but this web friend don’t. If caring were a medicine, It would already be overdosing .
